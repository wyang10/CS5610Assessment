        <h1>Comme des Garçons </h1>
        <p>Comme des Garçons (also known as CDG) is a Japanese fashion label based in Paris created and led by Rei Kawakubo.[1] The label began in 1969 and the company was founded in 1973. Its French flagship store is located in Paris. It has also established country-wide and world-wide store chains for various lines of products, including Dover Street Market, in major cities such as London, Melbourne, Hong Kong, New York City and Ginza.[2] Other than fashion, the label has expanded to include jewelry and perfume.[3]
        The company features their main collections during Paris Fashion Week and Paris Men's Fashion Week. In 2017, it was reported that the company and its affiliates generated a revenue "of over $280 million a year".</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The label was started in Tokyo by Rei Kawakubo in 1969 and established as a company in 1973. It is written in Japanese as コム・デ・ギャルソン (Komu de Gyaruson), and translates as "like boys" in French. The brand's name was inspired by Françoise Hardy's 1962 song "Tous les garçons et les filles", particularly from the line "Comme les garçons et les filles de mon âge." The brand became successful in Japan in the 1970s and a menswear line was added in 1978. In 1981, the company had a debut show in Paris. Kawakubo's heavy use of black, as well as distressed fabrics, and unfinished seams, were viewed negatively by French critics.
            Throughout the 1980s, its clothes often were associated with a distressed and punk-oriented style. In 1982, Kawakubo's collection which she named "Destroy" was heavily criticized. Women's Wear Daily called it the "Hiroshima bag lady look", and the Associated Press proclaimed Kawakubo the "high priestess of the Jap wrap". Unusual styles continued through the 1990s, many of which were disliked by experts. The company continued producing products however, and in 2004, the company split its business into handmade garments in produced France and non-handmade garments in Japan, Spain and Turkey. The product line Play, which is the most recognizable and mainstream Comme des Garçons casual luxury line, is largely produced in Japan, Spain and Turkey, but some of its product are also made in France.
